Today, I did my final intern presentation at Google. I presented to about 20 Software Engineers. I felt anxious earlier in the day but once in the room, I felt more confident.
I am not sure how lol. Maybe because my hosts said it was going to be fine? Maybe because everyone had a smile on, or perhaps because I was confident in my work.

The presentation went very well. Proud of myself for that one I  must say. But after this, I had a strong urge to start documenting some of these important (or so I think) happenings in my life. I think it will help me be more accountable to my self.

So here it is! I will share my expiriences of most things I encounter, give my opinions on various issues, talk about my technical projects, internships, career and sports. I hope you have fun reading.

Today, I did my final internal presentation. I presented to about 20 Software Engineers. I felt anxious earlier in the day but once in the room, I felt more confident.
I am not sure how lol. Maybe because my hosts said it was going to be fine? Maybe because everyone had a smile on, or perhaps because I was confident in my work.

The presentation went very well. Proud of myself for that one I  must say. But after this, I had the string urge to start documenting some of these important(or so I think)
